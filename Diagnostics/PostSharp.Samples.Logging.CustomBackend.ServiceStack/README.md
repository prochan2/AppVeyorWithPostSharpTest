This example shows how to implement an PostSharp Logging adapter for an arbitraty logging framework. We use the term *back-end* indifferently to mean 
either the adapter either the target logging framework itself.

We chose `ServiceStack.Logging` as the example framework, but you can easily follow the same techniques to build an adapter for your own back-end.
